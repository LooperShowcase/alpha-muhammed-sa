    <h1>MESSI , A LONG SUCSSES STORY</h1>
  
    <hr />
    <p>
      Lionel Andres Messi , The One and Only .<br />
      A World champion that wanted to achieve all his lovers dream wich is
      winning the golden World Cup. <br />
      You can say he was homeless before copa america 2021 that was a begining
      to his glory with the national team Argentina , Before that Leo was a hero
      in barcelona football club wich he could win 4 champions leauges with them
      in addition to the 11 la ligas he won with the spanish club
    </p>

      His head : <br />
      well he could decide a lot of trophies with his tiny head as you all can see in the link down the picture , he could take part in the 2009 champions leauge trophy and constribte winning the title for Barcelona city
    , but he could not particpate in the former final with Barcelona in 2006 because of his injury . <br/> 
    Messi could decid more trophies with his head as I said above but not phiscally but with his mind that can  analyse defenders moves and make the difference out of thier mistakes as he did in the 2015 final , even though he didnt score or asist in this game but all the three goals were scored bucause of his type of play that depends on dribbling and long passes between the rival team defenders <hr>

    <div id = "left">
      <p> His left foot : <br/> his left is just spectacular and it's a gift from god to him, you can see the video of him  playing with FC Barcelona b team and it was the first match for him , and with zero feeling pressure  he played that well and could score and asist in the game , as he did with his head he did the same thing in his left foot, scored in a lot of important games like 2022 qatar world cuo final not once but thrice .      </p>

syndrome </p>
